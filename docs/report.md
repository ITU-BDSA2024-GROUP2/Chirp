# Design and Architecture of _Chirp!_

Onion Architecture

The chirp project is heavily inspired by the onion architecture, which is seen the general composition of the code. The code is split into three different layers, that are designed to operate independently from each other. These layers are as follows: 
A chirp core layer, that is the domain of the project. This layer is responsible for defining what the project is. The code for a cheep, like or a user is defined here. 
Furthermore the project has an infrastructure layer, that defines how data is handled and received by the application. True to the onion architecture, this layer is build upon the core layer, which means that infrastructure uses core and builds upon it. E.g there is a repository that handles cheeps from core. 
Lastly there exists a chirp web layer, that covers the razor pages and generally the frontend development of the project. Again true to onion architecture this layer uses core and infrastructure.

Having the project split up into separate layers is optimal for testing. Since they are so loosely coupled the core of the project can be tested independently without the other layers. This makes a foundation for good testing. In addition this means that the outer layers can be modified without affecting the inner layers. This results in easy scalability and maintainability. All in all this architecture greatly benefits the project in the long run.


## Domain model
<!---
Provide an illustration of your domain model. Make sure that it is correct and complete. In case you are using ASP.NET Identity, make sure to illustrate that accordingly.
-->
 
Here comes a description of our domain model.

## Architecture â€” In the small
<!---
Illustrate the organization of your code base. That is, illustrate which layers exist in your (onion) architecture. Make sure to illustrate which part of your code is residing in which layer.
-->

## Architecture of deployed application
<!---
Illustrate the architecture of your deployed application. Remember, you developed a client-server application. Illustrate the server component and to where it is deployed, illustrate a client component, and show how these communicate with each other.
-->

## User activities
<!---
Illustrate typical scenarios of a user journey through your Chirp! application. That is, start illustrating the first page that is presented to a non-authorized user, illustrate what a non-authorized user can do with your Chirp! application, and finally illustrate what a user can do after authentication.

Make sure that the illustrations are in line with the actual behavior of your application.
-->

## Sequence of functionality/calls trough _Chirp!_
<!---
With a UML sequence diagram, illustrate the flow of messages and data through your Chirp! application. Start with an HTTP request that is send by an unauthorized user to the root endpoint of your application and end with the completely rendered web-page that is returned to the user.

Make sure that your illustration is complete. That is, likely for many of you there will be different kinds of "calls" and responses. Some HTTP calls and responses, some calls and responses in C# and likely some more. (Note the previous sentence is vague on purpose. I want that you create a complete illustration.)
-->

# Process

## Build, test, release, and deployment
<!---
Illustrate with a UML activity diagram how your Chirp! applications are build, tested, released, and deployed. That is, illustrate the flow of activities in your respective GitHub Actions workflows.

Describe the illustration briefly, i.e., how your application is built, tested, released, and deployed.

## Team work
<!---
Show a screenshot of your project board right before hand-in. Briefly describe which tasks are still unresolved, i.e., which features are missing from your applications or which functionality is incomplete.

Briefly describe and illustrate the flow of activities that happen from the new creation of an issue (task description), over development, etc. until a feature is finally merged into the main branch of your repository.

## How to make _Chirp!_ work locally
<!---
There has to be some documentation on how to come from cloning your project to a running system. That is, Adrian or Helge have to know precisely what to do in which order. Likely, it is best to describe how we clone your project, which commands we have to execute, and what we are supposed to see then.
-->

To run the program locally, you will first have to clone the repository. Then you have to type in the secrets for the program. The secrets are as following:
ClientID: `Ov23li6lCKKhGGXefnEf`
ClientSecret: `460047215cdea005fd386c508c0ae3dc1412c20d`
Open the project in your terminal, and type the following command, and replace `<YOUR_CLIENTID>` with the ClientID. Then do the same for client secret:
`dotnet user-secrets set "authentication_github_clientId" "<YOUR_CLIENTID>"`
`dotnet user-secrets set "authentication_github_clientSecret" "<YOUR_CLIENTSECRET>"`

After the secrets have been set, cd into the src folder, and then cd into the src/Chirp.Web folder. From here you simply type `dotnet run`

## How to run test suite locally
<!---
List all necessary steps that Adrian or Helge have to perform to execute your test suites. Here, you can assume that we already cloned your repository in the step above.

Briefly describe what kinds of tests you have in your test suites and what they are testing.
-->

If you want to run the tests, you have to open the Chirp folder in the terminal. Then type `dotnet test`. If some tests are failing, try deleting the database from the src/Chirp.Web folder. Additionally check if there is a .db file in the test/Chirp.API.Tests/bin. If there is one, delete that too. Then run it again.

# Ethics

## License
<!---
State which software license you chose for your application.
-->
Chirp uses the MIT License. 

## LLMs, ChatGPT, CoPilot, and others
<!---
State which LLM(s) were used during development of your project. In case you were not using any, just state so. In case you were using an LLM to support your development, briefly describe when and how it was applied. Reflect in writing to which degree the responses of the LLM were helpful. Discuss briefly if application of LLMs sped up your development or if the contrary was the case. 
-->
During the preparation of Chirp we have used ChatGPT to assist our development and learning process. In general we have been very cautious with our consumption of ChatGPT and always consulted the official documentation, TAs or websites like Stack Overflow first. The primary goal and intend by using a LLM is to improve our understanding of the course material and frameworks used. We think that the responses from ChatGPT was especially helpful in understanding complex concepts. Contrary we think that responses from ChatGPT was not very helpful in speeding up development as it overcomplicates many aspects an does not have a deep understanding of our domain model like we do ourselves.
